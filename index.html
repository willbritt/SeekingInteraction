    <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/"> Data Visualization </a>
    
    <p> The visualization I chose features the use of the hover method primarily. Its use is so that the viewers of the poll can
        clearly see the ratings comparison between the approvers and disprovers of President Trump. The visualization also uses both,
        scatterplots to report on every entry of data, and a line graph to show an average rating. These charts also are constantly
        updating with the interactions of the viewer using the functions of the mouse. To construct the animation/interaction
        used in the visualization with D3, I would use the provided attribute functions in javascript for data visuals. Focusing on the 
        hover method, I would append the on, hover, and transitions attributes to a normal bar chart function. The selectAll function
        also comes in useful when dealing with the visual properties of the chart. Ultimately, these attributes/methods will allow
        me to use desgins such as highlights, labels/tooltips, and data/visual updates in order to create dynamic visualizations.
